I can't deny it; I'm a life-long horror movie fan. Over the years, I've managed at least to upgrade from slasher flicks to more thoughtful horror movies and avoid the swamp of 'torture porn', but I just can't quit the genre. Unfortunately my husband dislikes scary movies, so as Halloween approaches, I'll have to indulge in these movies on my own. Following are some of the films that I've especially enjoyed. The list isn't meant to be definitive in anyway, just a few gems that you might want to check out in the nights leading up to Halloween.
